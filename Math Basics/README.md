### Linear Regression
```
Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  
The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: (1) does a set of
predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?
(2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome
variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and
sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?
These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship
between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent and one
independent variable is defined by the formula y = c + b*x, where y = estimated
dependent variable score, c = constant, b = regression coefficient,
and x = score on the independent variable.

y = c + b*x
y: estimated dependent variable, intercept, outcome
c: constant
b: regression coefficient, slope
x: score on the independent variable, control, manipulate, change

### Polynomial
```
A polynomial is a sum of one or more terms, where each term consists
of a constant and one or more variables raised to some non-negative
integer exponents. A polynomial with only one term is called a monomial,
two terms, a binomial and three terms, a trinomial.

2x^2 + 40x^3y^2 + x^2y

The degree of an individual term in a polynomial is the sum of
the exponents of the variables in that term. For example,
the term x2y3 has a degree of 5, since the exponents of the
variables x and y (2 and 3 respectively) add up to 5.

Factoring binomial with exponents
1). x^2 + 4x
  = x (x + 4)
2). 12y^3 - 18y^5
  = 12y^3 / 6y^3 = 2
  = -18y^5 / 6y^3 = -3y^2
  = 6y^3 [2 - 3y^2]
3). x^2 - 36
  = (x - 6) (x + 6)
4). 4x^2 - 64
  = 4 [x^2 - 16]
  = 4 (x - 4)(x + 4)
5). 3x^2 - 108
  = 3 [x^2 - 36]
  = 3 (x - 6) (x + 6)
6). 9x^2 - 49
  = (3x - 7)(3x + 7)
